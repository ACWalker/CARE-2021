Here are a few documents that can be useful for the project:

* Computer vision explainability and crowdsourcing: our paper "What do You Mean? Interpreting Image Classification with Crowdsourced Concept Extraction and Analysis" --if you search for the title at this link https://www2021.thewebconf.org/program/papers-program/links/, you can find the .pdf of the paper.
* Bird classification: 
  * Here, you can find a dataset of bird images: https://dl.allaboutbirds.org/nabirds
  * Don't use the whole dataset, at least for the start. There are many classes, it would be quite costly. I would advise you to only take a few classes. The following ones are quite interesting (you might want to use these), some birds are quite similar, others are very different. It should ensure you to get a diversity of annotations. 
  * Bird species: American Goldfinch, Lesser goldfinch, Gila woodpecker, Pine Grosbeaks, Mandarin duck, Hooded merganser, Bufflehead, Downy Woodpeckers, Hairy Woodpeckers, Savannah Sparrow, Vesper Sparrow.
